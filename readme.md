Originally written with WLA-DX and some
puzzles I generated way long ago. Now,
written in bass and the puzzles are generated
with python 2 at build-time.

Read readme-original.txt for the juicy stuff.
To build, if you have python2 and gnu make,
just do make.

COMPLETELY PUBLIC DOMAIN. Yes, even the generator.
